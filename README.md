# Aumet

- Your years of experience: 
  2-3 years

- Any challenges you faced during the task:
1. initializing firebase in flutter web was tricky, so i used the firebase CLI at the end (took so much time)
2. getting familiar with Riverpod in a short time 
3. making the app resonsive in web page (maximize and minimize the browser in Auth screen)
4. the API response doesn't have an ID so i used the university name instead (there is duplication)

- If this is your first time using Riverpod:
  Yes

- If this is your first time using Flutter Web:
  Yes, and it was super fun :)

- Did you need more time, or think the time is adequate:
Yes, i'm not really happy with my code. i can make it more solid and a lot of UI enhancement if i had more time
